\begin{enumerate}

\item Make sure everything's committed
\item If tagging a major version:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Open command line
    \item \fbox{\texttt{git tag}} to see current tags
    \item \fbox{\texttt{git tag 0.13.6}} (make sure to use \texttt{0.15.0} and not \texttt{0.15})
    \item \fbox{\texttt{git push origin 0.13.6}}
    \item Run \texttt{generateVersionHeader.sh}
    \end{enumerate}

\item Build Release in Visual Studio (needs to build with new commit/tag as version)
\item Update \texttt{release-notes.txt}, ensuring version is correct.
\item Watch the server-recovery process.  Wait until its 20-second timer has just started.
\item Quickly:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Kill the currently running production server
    \item Run publish-new-server script.
\end{enumerate}
\item Check reported server version on server-status page.
\item Run publish-new-client script.
\item Play Production as a quick smoke test
\item Check reported server version in login screen.
\item Make sure player-made objects have persisted.
\item Make sure rocks/sticks/\emph{etc.}\,are spawning on the ground.

\end{enumerate}
