Mechanics:
A dungeon gate.  Will ultimately move you into the dungeon instance.  For now,
 - Teleport you to a designated location
 - Provide the name of the dungeon (and suggested levels)
 - Always visible, if that part of the map has been explored.
Think about how everything in the dungeon can be reset over time.  The way mobs respawn after... 1h?
