<entry name="Object placement" >
    <p text="Some items can be placed into the world as objects.  If an item has this ability, then its tooltip will include 'Right click to place (Object)'." />
    <p text="To place an object, right-click the item in your inventory.  The mouse cursor will now show a footprint of how large the object will be.  Click on the ground to place it; note that placement may take some time, depending on the object.  The placement area must be clear of any obstacles, and close to the player; the footprint will turn red if it is too far away.  It must also be a terrain type that is compatible with the object." />
    <p text="Often this will be enough, but sometimes a construction site will be created instead of the finished object.  In this case, after the construction site is designated, materials can be added.  Right-click on the site, and you will see a list of items required to complete the object.  To add an item, move it from your inventory (I key) into the item slot in the object window." />

<entry name="Object construction" >
    <p text="Some objects can be constructed from scratch.  A construction site is designated, and then materials must be added before the object is fully functional." />
    <p text="To construct an object, press 'B' or click on the 'Build window' button on the toolbar.  This will bring up a list of all construction projects that you have unlocked.  Click on the one you want." />

<entry name="Crafting" >
    <p text="Some items can be crafted using other items as materials.  Each such recipe can only be crafted once you learn it." />
    <p text="To craft an item, press 'C' or click on the 'Crafting' button on the toolbar.  This will bring up the crafting window." />
    <p text="On the left side of the window you will find a number of filters to shorten the list of recipes on display.  In the middle are all matching recipes that you know.  If you select one by clicking on it, the right side of the window will show the details of that recipe, including all materials required, any tools that you must have, and a button to actually begin crafting." />
</entry>

<entry name="Tools" >
    <p text="Some actions in the game require one or more tools.  A tool requirement is in terms of a type, rather than a specific thing.  For example, gathering a Tree requires anything of type 'Axe', rather than specifically requiring a Stone Axe or Copper Axe.  Types will appear in tooltips." />
    <p text="Tools are not consumed when used--they are passive participants in the action." />
    <p heading="Item tools"
        text="To use an item as a tool, it must be in your inventory or a gear slot." />
    <p heading="Object tools"
        text="For an object to work as a tool, it must be close to you, and you must have permission to use it.  This will generally mean it's owned by you or your city, or unowned." />
    <p heading="Terrain tools"
        text="Occasionally a map tile can be used as a tool.  In these cases the tile will behave just like an unowned object: the user must be close to it." />
</entry>

<entry name="Ownership" >
    <p heading="Ownership"
        text="Objects can be owned by individual players or cities, or be unowned.  An object's owner can be seen in the tooltip when the mouse cursor is over it.  Many of an object's actions are available only to its owner." />
    <p text="Naturally occuring objects are unowned.  When a player creates an object, it will automatically be owned by him." />
    <p text="If an object is owned by a city, then all citizens of that city can use the object." />
    <p heading="The object window"
        text="If an object has any actions available, they can be accessed through the object window.  To bring up an object window, make sure you are close to the object in question and right-click on it." />
</entry>

<entry name="Cities" >
    <p text="A city is a group of players who are joined together in a single diplomatic unit.  A player's city is displayed underneath their name.  When a new player begins, he is not in any city." />
    <p heading="Foundation"
        text="A city can be founded at an Altar to Athena.  The altar's object window allows the new city's name to be entered.  The player who worships at the altar will become King, and the city will stand only as long as his Altar to Athena does." />
    <p heading="Recruitment"
        text="Any member of a city can recruit new members.  To recruit a player to your city, click on him, right-click on the target panel at the top of the screen, and click 'Recruit'." />
    <p heading="City objects"
        text="Just as objects can be owned by a player, they can instead be owned by a city.  A city-owned object is accessible by all members of the city.  In order for an object to come under the ownership of a city, a player must cede one of his own objects to his city." />
    <p text="To cede an object, use the 'Cede to City' button in the object window.  An object can only be ceded if it belongs to the player, it is not an Altar, and the player is in a city." />
    <p heading="Leaving a city"
        text="To leave your city, open the Social window with 'O' or the button on the toolbar.  Then, click the 'Leave city' button." />
    <p text="Note that a king cannot leave his city." />
    <p heading="Destruction"
        text="If a city's Altar to Athena is destroyed, then the city is destroyed.  All citizens become citiless, and all city objects crumble into ruin." />
</entry>

<entry name="War" >
    <p text="At any given time, two players are either at peace or at war.  When at war, you may attack the player or any objects he owns.  Combat between players can only take place in a state of war." />
    <p text="A city can also be at war, and a city's diplomatic state supercedes that of its citizens.  If you are at war with a city, then you may engage in combat with any citizen of that city, and any object owned by a citizen or by the city itself." />
    <p heading="Active and inactive wars"
        text="Every war is either active or inactive.  An active war means that the belligerents can fight each other, whereas an inactive war is effectively a truce.  A war is inactive if at least one of the belligerents is a player, and that player is in a city; the city's diplomatic state takes precedence."/>
    <p text="For example, if Domos is at war with Timos, they can fight.  If Domos then joins a city, then that personal war takes a back seat; the players can fight only if Domos's city is at war with Timos.  The personal war is resumed if Domos leaves his city."/>
    <p heading="Managing wars"
        text="Your active wars can be managed in the Social window, opened by pressing 'O' or clicking the 'Social window' button on the toolbar.  The bottom section of the window lists all of your active wars."/>
</entry>

<entry name="Talents" >
    <p text="There are a number of talents available with which you can customise and specialise your character.  Some give you passive stat boosts, and some teach you new spells or abilities.  The set of talents is based on your class, and one talent point is awarded each time you gain a level."/>
    <p text="Talents are managed in the Class window, which can be opened by pressing 'K'."/>
    <p heading="Branches and levels"
        text="The available talents are based on your class, and they are further split into three branches representing your roles in society."/>
    <p text="Within a branch, talents are further divided into vertical levels.  Talents at the top have no special requirements, and cost a small amount of food to learn." />
    <p text="As you move down, talents may need tools to learn, and they require a number of talents points to already be allocated in that branch.  This allows you to choose how deeply you want to specialise."/>
    <p text="More advanced talents cost more food, and may also require additional items as part of the cost." />
    <p heading="Changing your mind"
        text="If you want to allocate your talents differently, at any time you may unlearn all of your talents by clicking on the 'Unlearn all' button in the Class window." />
    <p text="Note that you will need to pay the food and item costs of each talent point once again.  Thus, at higher levels the cost of revising your talents can be quite high." />
    <p heading="Death"
        text="When you die, you lose one random talent point.  You can allocate the point again, but you must once again bear its food and item costs." />
