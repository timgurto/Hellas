    Zeus, the king of these Olympian gods, wants you humans to worship his kind with animal sacrifices.
    Before we negotiate the details, you'll need to get your hands dirty.  There's a small pass north of the pigs you just encountered, that leads to a herd of wild goats.  Slay some, and gather what you can of their remains."

    Don't look at me like that--we're talking about an eternity of sacrifices here, and this will make it easier for you humans!
    Follow the path up north, until you find a smoking brazier.  That is where Zeus will make his choice.
    Place this pile of meat on the tiles there, and cover it with the hide so that it looks skinny and unappealing.  Do the same with the entrails, but dress them up with fat.  Once you've prepared both sacrifices, approach the brazier--reverently--and speak with Zeus."
    debrief="Greetings, mortal.  Are you one of Prometheus's little creatures?
    We gods have our due, and as their king it falls to me to make the choice.  But obviously we should have the best-quality meat for ourselves!  I choose the fatty offering."

Sure, they sided with the enemy, but the blood of the Titans flows through their veins too and they might be willing to bargain."
