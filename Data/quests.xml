    brief="You are mortal, like the birds and beasts, but unlike them you have a spirit.  Thus, in the Great Chain of Being, you sit above them.
    I built you to be capable, with a broad chest and strong arms: enough to assert your position in the order of things.  To check that you actually can, go out and kill some beasts.
    Look around nearby for a Pig, and target it by right-clicking on it.  Once you move close enough, you will automatically start attacking it.  I'd like you to kill five.
    You can see your progress on the right-hand side of the screen."

    I suppose I should introduce myself.  My name is Prometheus, and I created you.  Welcome to the world!">

    brief="Zeus wants to choose which parts of the animal should henceforth be sacrificed to the gods, and so you'll need to make two offerings.
    I'm very fond of you humans, and so I'll suggest a way that we can cheat him.  We're talking about an eternity of sacrifices, so every little bit helps!
    Place these piles of meat and entrails on those tiles near the brazier.  Then, cover them with the hide and fat respectively.
    Once you've done all that, approach the brazier, reverently, and speak with Zeus.
    To place an item, right-click it and then left-click on the ground.  To add materials to an object, right-click on it, then when the object window appears, move an item to it from your inventory."
