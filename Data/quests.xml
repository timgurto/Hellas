    brief="You are mortal, like the birds and beasts, but unlike them you have a spirit.  Thus, in the Great Chain of Being, you sit above them.
    
    I built you to be capable, with a broad chest and strong arms: enough to assert your position in the order of things.  To check that you actually can, go out and kill some beasts.
    
    Look around nearby for a Pig, and target it by right-clicking on it.  Once you move close enough, you will automatically start attacking it.  I'd like you to kill five."
    debrief="Excellent, everything seems to be working as intended.

    I suppose I should introduce myself.  My name is Prometheus, and I created you.  Welcome to the world!">
