    brief="Some animals can attack, up close or from far away.  Some do physical damage, and others draw on the elements.  Some can protect themselves with shields, and others can restore health.
    With your help, I have decided on a gift to bestow upon mankind: you will receive them all.  No man can excel at everything, but together, you and your fellow humans will have access to each of these gifts.  Another gift I grant you is reason--the ability to know and improve yourself, and choose how best to make the most of your talents.
    Now it's time to leave this mountain for good, and enter the wider world.  To do this, enlist the aid of my cousin Eos; she is the goddess of the dawn, and will gladly help to establish mankind in the mortal realm.  Travel northeast and look for her Altar."
    debrief="As you can see, Zeus has seen fit to punish me for sharing fire with you against his wishes.  At least this bird isn't cooking my liver before eating it!  Heh heh ...
    No matter, I made my decision and I will live with it."
